> # Our Beloved Summer :partly_sunny: 
One of the Greatest K-drama in history
> ## About the Series
### At its very core,its a drama about how people deal with loneliness and the feeling of abandonment and simple human emotions. Everything about this drama feels so human. They all grew from the people they were at the beginning. Their progression felt so natural. That is the beauty of the drama, it takes simple human emotions and presents them so vulnerably that we all can relate to some part of it.
